# Car-Price-Prediction-Project
The aim of this project is to predict the possible car price for a Chinese company Geely auto mobile who intends to enter the Nigerian Market
Problem Statement
A Chinese automobile company Geely Auto aspires to enter the Nigerian market by setting up its
manufacturing unit and producing cars locally to compete with their Nigerian, US and European
counterparts.
They have contacted you, a Data Scientist to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars
depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the pricing of cars in the Nigerian
market, since those may be very different from the Chinese market.
The company wants to know:
● Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car
● How well do those variables describe the price of a car
Based on various market surveys, you have gathered a large data set of different types of cars
across the Nigerian market.
Business Goal (Objective)
You are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. The
management will use it to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables.
They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain
price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing
dynamics of a new market.
